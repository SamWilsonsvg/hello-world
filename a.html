Do's and Don'ts of Hacktoberfest
Don't: Open pull requests with minor text edits on other people's repositories
If you're looking for a faster way to open four PR's and win, there's a better way!

Do: Follow a repository's contribution guidelines
Almost every repo looking for help has a CONTRIBUTING.md file in it, read it first!

Don't: Feel intimidated
